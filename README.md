## Usage
Blender **MUST** be launched with administrative privileges for BlenderQuery to install its dependencies, and to write intermediate CadQuery export files to disk.

BlenderQuery can be located under the `Object Properties` panel, where you are able to select your CadQuery script to run for the selected object.
